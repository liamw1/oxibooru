## Converting from Szurubooru

### Before Starting
All software is fallible, especially software that hasn't been extensively
tested. Please make a back up of your database before attempting a conversion.

This guide assumes you have set up an Oxibooru instance already. See the 
[installation instructions](INSTALL.md) for more details. It also assumes
the Oxibooru database is _empty_, which is the case on an initial install.
Make sure that you run the server container at least once to make sure
it has been installed correctly and that the migrations have been applied.

The guide doesn't cover migrating the config.yaml, but the structure of
the Oxibooru equivalent, config.toml, is almost identical. Just copy over the
settings from the config.yaml manually if you want them.

If you encounter any issues during the conversion process, please open up an
issue on [Github](https://github.com/liamw1/oxibooru/issues).

### Known Limitations
Some aspects of a Szurubooru instance can't be converted to an Oxibooru
instance. Depending on how you're using your database, these limitations may
make total migration difficult or impossible. In order of decreasing severity,
these are:

1. **Passwords**

    Password hashing is done a bit differently in Oxibooru,
    so this unfortunately means that passwords can't be migrated over at the
    moment. Passwords can be reset individually via the admin cli, but this is
    impractical and insecure for databases with many users. If there are any 
    such databases out there in production, it may be best to stick with
    Szurubooru for the forseeable future.
    
2. **Some image formats**
    
    Currently, Oxibooru doesn't support AVIF, HEIF, or HEIC file formats.
    In the future, support for AVIF is very likely. HEIF and HEIC are a little
    less likely and depends on if I can find a good crate for them.

3. **Some post types**

    Oxibooru does not currently support YouTube posts and is unlikely to
    support them in the future.

4. **Snapshots**

    Snapshots are not implemented in Oxibooru, and I don't have plans to
    implement them unless someone gives me a compelling case for them. I'm still
    not sure what purpose they actually served in Szurubooru. If you're a big
    snapshot fan then you may want to hold off on migrating.

5. **Post Notes**
    
    Post notes are represented very poorly in the Szurubooru database. The
    polygon column is stored as a serialized Python object, which makes
    conversion very difficult as their exact layout is both hard to determine
    and platform-dependent. These simply aren't handled in the conversion script
    at the moment due to the complexity involved.

### Let's begin
1. **Create a dump of the Szurubooru database**

    Navigate to the Szurubooru source directory and run
    ```console
    user@host:szuru$ docker compose up -d sql
    user@host:szuru$ docker exec szuru-sql-1 pg_dump -U ${SZURU_POSTGRES_USER} --no-owner --no-privileges szuru > backup.sql
    ```
    where ${SZURU_POSTGRES_USER} is the value of the POSTGRES_USER environment
    variable defined in the Szurubooru .env file.
    
2. **Restore Szurubooru database**
    
    Navigate to the Oxibooru source directory and run
    ```console
    user@host:oxibooru$ docker compose up -d sql
    ```
    Now move backup.sql to the Oxibooru directory, create a szuru schema in 
    the Oxibooru database and restore the Szurubooru database.
    ```console
    user@host:oxibooru$ docker exec oxibooru-sql-1 psql -U ${POSTGRES_USER} -d ${POSTGRES_DB} -c "ALTER SCHEMA public RENAME TO ${POSTGRES_DB};"
    user@host:oxibooru$ docker exec oxibooru-sql-1 psql -U ${POSTGRES_USER} -d ${POSTGRES_DB} -c "CREATE SCHEMA public;"
    user@host:oxibooru$ cat backup.sql | docker exec -i oxibooru-sql-1 psql -U ${POSTGRES_USER} -d ${POSTGRES_DB}
    ```
    Here ${POSTGRES_USER} and ${POSTGRES_DB} are the values of the
    POSTGRES_USER and POSTGRES_DB environment variables defined in the 
    Oxibooru .env file.
    
3. **Run conversion script**
    ```console
    user@host:oxibooru$ cat scripts/convert_szuru_database.sql | docker exec -i oxibooru-sql-1 psql -U ${POSTGRES_USER} -d ${POSTGRES_DB} --single-transaction
    ```
    Any errors encountered will rollback the conversion of the database. If you 
    would like to opt-out of this behavior and attempt a partial conversion, you
    can omit the --single-transaction argument.

    Pool and tag names are unique and case insenstive in Oxibooru, so "tag" 
    and "Tag" can't coexist in the database. In Szurubooru, it is possible
    that these can coexist, although it generally tries to prevent it. In the
    event that your Szurubooru database contains names which only differ by 
    case, those names will be modified to {name}\_name\_modified\_{tag_id}\_{order}
    to prevent conflicts. You can search for the affected tag/pool names by 
    entering \*\_name_modified\_\* in the tag/pool search bar.

4. **Rename data files**

    Oxibooru uses a different file naming convention, so these will need to be 
    recomputed. First, if you have any custom-thumbnails, you should move the
    custom-thumbnails folder from MOUNT_DATA/posts/custom-thumbnails to
    MOUNT_DATA/custom-thumbnails. 

    Next, make sure the MOUNT_DATA environment variable is pointed towards the
    data directory of the Szurubooru database. This step will modify the
    filenames of posts and thumbnails, making Szurubooru unable to read them.
    This should be reversible using the Szurubooru admin function 
    reset_filenames(), but I haven't tested that so you may want to make a
    backup.

    Now, spin up the Oxibooru containers:
    ```console
    user@host:oxibooru$ docker compose up -d
    ```
    Now, enter Oxibooru's admin cli:
    ```console
    user@host:oxibooru$ docker exec -it oxibooru-server-1 ./server --admin
    ```
    From there, run the reset_filenames command, which will automatically
    rename every file in the data directory to match the Oxibooru convention.
    ```console
    Please select a task: reset_filenames
    ```

5. **Compute thumbnail sizes**

    Oxibooru stores thumbnail sizes along with file sizes so it can quickly
    compute the size of the database. To store sizes of existing thumbnails,
    run reset_thumbnail_sizes in the admin cli:
    ```console
    Please select a task: reset_thumbnail_sizes
    ```

    This step is optional. The only effect skipping it would have is that
    the disk usage that the client displays will be slightly inaccurate.

6. **Recompute post properties**

    Oxibooru also uses a different checksum and image signature algorithm, so 
    these will need to be recomputed. These can both be accomplished via the 
    admin cli.
    
    Run recompute_post_checksums and recompute_post_signatures in the admin
    cli. For databases with many posts, these functions can take a bit of time
    to complete, so be prepared for that. recompute_post_checksums runs at 
    around 240 posts/sec and recompute_post_signatures runs at around 150 
    posts/sec on my machine.
    ```console
    Please select a task: recompute_post_checksums
    ```
    ```console
    Please select a task: recompute_post_signatures
    ```
    
7. **Reset user passwords**

    At this point the database is almost completely converted to a proper
    Oxibooru instance. However, there are still some important things not
    covered by the previous steps. Currently, users won't be able to login using
    their original passwords. This is because of differences in how Oxibooru 
    hashes and salts user passwords. At the moment, the only way to recover 
    these users is to reset their passwords. For personal databases with a small
    number of users, this can be done via the admin cli fairly easily.
    
    Upon entering reset_password in the admin cli, you will be prompted for the
    username whose password you want to reset and the new password you would 
    like for that user.
    ```console
    Please select a task: reset_password
    ```
    
8. **We're done!**
